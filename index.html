      Atom is really beautiful and great. One of my favorite features are
      snip-its. <br />
      For example if you are editing HTML and you type in the words html and
      press space it will replace it with all of this:
    </q>

    <pre><code class="language-html" >
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <input type="checkbox" checked />Is it <strong>free</strong>?<br />
    <input type="checkbox" checked />Is it <strong>easy</strong> to use?<br />
    <input type="checkbox" checked />Is it <strong>customizable</strong>?<br />
    <input type="checkbox" checked />Does it support a lot of

    <p>
      Atom's easy of use will allow me to be very productive while keeping
      frustration minimal. <br />
      While it's customization options will ensure it won't be absolete in the
      near future.

    <q>
      Although it's a good product, it has been through a number of major
      evolutionary stages. <br />
      Its major advantages are that since it was a production from the very
      people who invented Java (Sun),<br />
      it should in theory anticipate improvements to Java and support
      Java-specific features. <br />
      To a certain degree, it does, although Sun could have done more,
      especially when it came to JavaBean development and design, <br />
      which are 2 aspects where NetBeans does have an edge on Eclipse to begin
      with. <br />
      Because NetBeans doesn't attempt to be all things to all people, <br />
      it does tend to provide better support for "grunt" development, whereas
      Eclipse is more my cup of tea,<br />
      since I'm more prone to develop systems with multiple components
      interacting in complex ways and non-Java components.

      NetBean doesn't seem to have much support beyond Java. <br />
      While there are still things lacking it might be worthwile in the future.

    <q
      >Overall I was very impressed with VSCode, to the point that I've
      considered moving to it more permanently.<br />
      I'm still yet to take that step to fully dive in, but I think it would be
      a nice holiday project to configure it to meet similar standards I am used
      to in Sublime. <br />
      After that, I think I really could stick with it for longer. <br />
      The Git integration and in-editor debugger are great features that I've
      struggled with in Sublime but worked almost immediately in VSCode.

      Visual Studio Code seems to be very popular and has a big community for
      support. <br />
      I'll be giving it a try if ATOM doesn't work for me. iuyiuh
